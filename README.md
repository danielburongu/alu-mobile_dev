<h2>Market Master</h2>
<h4>Problem:</h4>
<p>Foreign students often face challenges adapting to new environments, especially regarding understanding local markets and pricing. Overcharging can be a common issue, making budgeting and daily life stressful. This project proposes a mobile application built in Flutter using Dart to address these challenges and assist foreign students in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>Providing accurate and up-to-date market prices: The app will fetch real-time or regularly updated prices of various goods from different market locations.</li>
  <li>Facilitating easy comparison: Compare prices between different markets for the same items, allowing students to make informed purchasing decisions.</li>
  <li>Avoiding overcharging: Help students identify potential overcharging situations by presenting average price ranges for specific goods.</li>
  <li>
Simplifying shopping: Implement a shopping cart feature where students can add items and view their estimated total cost, aiding in budgeting and planning.</li>
</ul>
